## SERVQUAL Method
The servqual method is a method used to measure the service quality of the attributes of each dimension, so that the gap value will be the difference between the consumer perception of the services that have been received with the hope of what will be received.

**SERVQUAL Dimensions**

Servqual scale includes five dimensions of service quality, namely; Tangibles, Reliability, Responsiveness, Assurance, and Empathy. Each dimension has several questions and is answered in a range of values of 1 to 5, where number 1 represents feelings of strong disagreement (strongly disagree) and number 5 represents feelings of strong agreement (strongly agree). The following is an explanation of the 5 dimensions above:

- **Reliability**, Refer to the ability to provide services that are promised accurately and reliably.
- **Responsiveness**, namely willingness to help customers and give right attention.
- **Assurance**, is a polite and knowledgeable employee who gives trust and confidence.
- **Tangibles**, Describe physical facilities, equipment, and appearance of personnel and the presence of users.
- **Empathy**, includes concern and individual attention to users.
